# Mag

## What?

A very simple library to allow you to type less with Maglev when committing or aborting to Maglev's NOSQL dark magic.

## Why?

I'm lazy, and "Mag.commit" saves me from typing 15 characters over "Maglev.commit_transaction"! Even better, "Mag.box" saves... I dun wanna count... characters over "Maglev::PERSISTENT_ROOT". =P

## How do I use it?

### First load the library:

`require 'rubygems'
require 'mag'`

### Now you have Mag's shorten Maglev commands:

* "Maglev.commit_transaction" becomes: 
    * "Mag.commit"
* "Maglev.abort_transaction" becomes:
    * "Mag.abort"
* "Maglev::PERSISTENT_ROOT" becomes:
    * "Mag.box"
